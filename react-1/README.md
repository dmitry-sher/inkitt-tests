## React (v1)

Simple typeahead/react-select alike. Created with `create-react-app`.

The main idea is: it's always easier today to find a decent library, at least to solve some most simple tasks. Typeaheads were around for years now. You can choose from a plenty.

So this one is based on `react-select@1.2.1`.

To see it in action: `yarn install && yarn start`.

To develop:
 - `yarn install`
 - run `yarn run watch-css` in one terminal.
 - run `yarn start` in another terminal.
